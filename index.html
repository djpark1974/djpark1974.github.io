    <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>

    <p class="container-text">I studied Natural Sciences at The University of Cambridge from 1992-1995, before completing my PhD in the Department of Biochemistry. Since then, I have worked across a wide range of molecular biology and bioinformatics projects.<br><br>Early in my career, while working to characterise some Australian marsupial genes, I developed a suite of methods for the determination of nucleic acid sequences flanking known regions - these allowed the resolution of RNA and DNA sequences that had proven intractible to prior approaches.</p>
