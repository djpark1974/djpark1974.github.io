    <p>I studied Natural Sciences at The University of Cambridge from 1992-1995, before completing my PhD in the Department of Biochemistry. Since then, I have worked across a wide range of molecular biology and bioinformatics projects.</p>
    <p> Early in my career, while working to characterise some Australian marsupial genes, I developed a suite of methods for the determination of nucleic acid sequences flanking known regions - these allowed the resolution of RNA and DNA sequences that had proven intractible to prior approaches.</p>
